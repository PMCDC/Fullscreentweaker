## This looks familiar, doesn't it?

**Fullscreen Tweaker** is an updated version of another app named **Fullscreenizer**.

I made this app because I wanted to mess around with the original source code of **Fullscreenizer** made by **Kostas "Bad Sector" Michalopoulos**. However, when I realised that the source
code was in **Pascal**, I decided to recode everything into something more modern.

I'm sharing the code here for anyone who know **C#** and want to tweak something or have fun with it.
