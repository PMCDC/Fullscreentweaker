# Fullscreen Tweaker

**Fullscreen Tweaker** allow you to adjust game's window into "Borderless Fullscreen". You find you game that is currently running in the list, you click "Fullscreenize" and thats it!

> Some video games does not support Borderless Fullscreen and this tool can help rectify this.

**Before you run the tool:**
> It is better that you set the game's resolution as the same of the monitor. That way, the visual of the game will remain clean.

**About 4:3 games:**
> The 4:3 option will adjust the game window and make it appear at the center of the monitor. It is better that you create an custom 4:3 resolution for your display and then set this resolution into the game's display option before you run the tool. 
>
> Example, for an 1080p monitor, instead of running the game in 1920x1080, you should set the game resolution to 1440x1080.

### Technologies
- C#
- .NET CORE 5

## This looks familiar, doesn't it?

**Fullscreen Tweaker** is an updated version of another app named **Fullscreenizer**.

I made this app because I wanted to mess around with the original source code of **Fullscreenizer** made by **Kostas "Bad Sector" Michalopoulos**. However, when I realised that the source
code was in **Pascal**, I decided to recode everything into something more modern.

I'm sharing the code here for anyone who know **C#** and want to tweak something or have fun with it.
